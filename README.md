# Success-Express-Station

"Success Express Station" is a small semester simulation game. The player navigates course load choices, attends four courses (Python, English 101, Calculus I, Art Appreciation), and makes study/social choices. Each course produces a hidden numeric grade; the final GPA is an average of those grades and determines one of multiple endings.

Branching logic
Course load influences study hours / stress / social stats.
Each course changes stats and produces a numeric grade (A..D scale as floats).
Mid-semester choices (coffee, parties, group study, Google event, pop quiz) change stats and affect grade outcomes.
The final GPA (calculated from the 4 course grades) is used to evaluate which ending the player reaches.

  Notes for graders / testers

  For automated testing, default choices are set as variables at the top of the script (so no interactive input is required).
